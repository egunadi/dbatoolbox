====================
SWHC migration
====================

+ New server has less space and memory, because it is supposed to be dedicated only to the medical databases
	?? Will this be an issue?

	! One core is not a good idea!
		With hyperthreading, 4 cores provides 8 different threads to do processing
			If there are interfaces, etc...
			
		With a hyperVM, we can set as many cores as desired... 

	Talk to John
		At the very least 2, but ideally 4
		Licensing?  Licensed per core?

	DMVs to monitor performance?

	There may be a performance hit with only 8 GB of memory....


+ Autogrowth has kicked in!!!!!!!!!!
	1. (Ideally) right before a FULL backup:
		Switch to SIMPLE, then back to FULL, then take a FULL backup
			When is the FULL backup set to run?
	2. DBCC LOGINFO shows that most of the logs are available for re-use. So:
		Run DBCC SHRINKFILE (set initial size to 1 GB with parameter, or by resizing the log)
		Do this while in SIMPLE recovery model
			Look-up why this is the case
		To reclaim disk space
		Also, this would "defragment" the log file, so data can be read contiguously

++ Compress backup - unchecked
	- For most people, CPU isn't an issue, so turn it on
	- Everything is quicker.  The only downside is CPU.                                                                                   
	- UNLESS, there are performance IO issues on target server...


++ Good that Max Memory is set to 12 GB.  The current OS has 16 GB of memory.  So this leaves ~2GB for the OS and ~2GB for applications.
	- Double check how much memory the target server has!
	- Also, check Resmon to see how much % of Physical Memory is used

++ Max DOP
	- Currently set to 0
	- Leave this at 0!

+ SWHCTEST is another SQL Server Instance....
	- Will this be migrated?
	- Can see in config mrg or services applet


+ Which SSIS packages should be migrated?
  - Where is the SSIS package for the Dashboard?
  - The "maintenance plan" ones will be created automatically by the maintenance plans
  - Familiarize CDW (Copy Database Wizard) & run by client
  	+ This is build by default by the Copy Database Wizard!
  - OR, export package to file system and investigate "under the hood"

++ If a MINet services are running under Local System, this means they are logging into SQL Server using "NT Authority\System", right? 
	- If Net Services are not in the same server, then don't worry about them!

++ In OneNote: SQL Service Accounts - Default Accounts?
	+ Check the SQL Services Account?
	- In the Configuration Manager > SQL Server Services
		* If it says "NT..." then it is default



====================
Westsound migration
====================
+ Ad hoc workload?
+ Max DOP (degree of parallelism)?
+ MAX Server Memory?
+ xp_CmdShell?

+ The first thing to do is to export the Login accounts over, especially the user-created ones with default database of "medical"
	!- Before exporting, "medical" must already exist in the new server.  Typically, this is done by creating a dummy "medical" database. 
		OR, one of the backups can be restored...but this will create orphaned users
			So port over user first using "master" as the default database
				THEN restore the database

		OR

		create a blank database labeled medical (necessary to import user account with default database setting).
		Importe user account "USR" from production server to new server.
		Remove blank database labeled medical.

	- export_sql_logins.sql	
		* Run this on the old server

	- exec sp_help_revlogin
		* This will show all the Login accounts that we may port over.  Run this by the client.
		* Anything with ## we do not need

	- user_accounts_to_export.sql
		* Generate this script to run on the new server

	!- Port over "usr" for now.  This is our account.  We need to discuss the other accounts with the client.

+ Script out the jobs
	!- Jobs created by Maintenance Plans do not need to be scripted out
	!- For now port over the first five ones

+ Tomorrow:
	- Backup the old database

======================
Paul Notes
======================

+ Check if proxies exists (ex. for SSIS)
	- Also check in Security > Credentials

+ Check to see if there are any SSIS packages in MSDB

+ "Extended Events" (which was introduced in SSMS 2008) can be used
	- It is similar to the Profiler

+ Navigate to Server Objects > Sys Endpoints > Default (?)

+ Check if there are any linked servers by quering the metadata

		SELECT * FROM sys.server
		SELECT @@servername -- Will show something like CPSQL2

	Linked servers will need to be moved

+ Compatibility level may have to be manually set
	- MI supports 2008R2 and above
	- parser or features?

+ SQL Server Config Mgr > SQL Server Network Config
	- Check Protocols to see how network config is defined
		* aka "How will I let users log into SQL?"
		* TCP/IP - internet
		* Named pipes (another protocol)
		* Shared memory (everything is local)
		* IP addresses
			> See which IPs (or IPALL) have a port
				# If dynamic ports used, others cannot connect?
				# 443 is the default port

+ Create migration tasks
	- Prereqs
	- Tasks
	- Firewall Port Exceptions


Coast Pain Management Migration:
--------------------------------
+ See if a full backup exists.  If not, take a full backup!

+ Is the SQL Server Agent running?  If not, turn on!

+ Use the scripts on GitHub to give an overview of what's installed on an instance
	- GitHub > medinformatix.sql > MIDB-Development > migration-sql > SQL_Migration_Overview.sql
		> Tim needs to update this
		> Run this on medical
		> Be sure to configure the company using the following query
			SELECT COMPANY, COUNT(*)
			FROM CLMASTER
			GROUP BY COMPANY
	- SqlServer_Config_Audit.sql
		> Run on master
		> This will give an in-depth look
			* Ex. sp configure

+ Examine the setup of the new server
	- What is the SQL Server Version?
		* Express cannot be used
	- What are the requirements?
	- What are the components in the old server that we must take into account?

+ Create usr & map to mwuser

+ Copy full bkp to new instance

+ Grant mwuser rights to MI objects

+ Create maintenance plan
	- For each subplan, copy what exists manually 
	- Do not use proxy (use the SQL Server auth instead)
	- Using the toolbar in the LHS, we can drag and drop
		* Assuming we are not using the Maintenance Plan Wizard

+ Configure server settings
	- Memory
		* 2 GB for MI
		* 2 GB for OS
	- Check compress backup (this uses more CPU)
	- Copy 'Advanced' settings directly
	- FULL recovery model must be set
	- Check the compatibility model
		* Leave this at 2008 for older MI versions
	- Where do they want the backups to reside?
		* Do they want the MDF & LDF to be on a separate drive than the .bak & .trn?
	- Are there firewall port exceptions?
		* 1433 for SQL Server
		* TCP 2383 for SSAS
		* TCP 135 for SSIS
		* UDP 1434 for SQL Server Browser
		* DOUBLE CHECK THESE!
		* These can be tested by connecting from another box
	- We don't need the following in the Config Mgr:
		* Reporting Services
		* Full-text Search (used for fuzzy matching, when users need more functionality than just select statements)
		* Browser (needed only when there are multiple instances)
		* DO NOT UNINSTALL THESE.  BUT THEY CAN BE TURNED OFF.
	- Do we have to create a SSIS proxy?
	- Is there a ctxstore setup?  If so, inform IT (?)
		* Apparently, ctxstore is a database....
	- Use perfmon counters for baselining (collecting metrics)
		* Collect data every 15 seconds
		* How many virtual processors are there?
		* Save data as BLG file
			relog $filename.blg -f csv -o $filename.csv



Sample Analyis
---------------------
Target Server:
**************
+ Is everything installed?
	 - SSMS
	 	* What edition?  Std?  Enterprise?  SPs & CU?
	 		> Run '@@version'
	 - SSAS
	 	* Check config mgr
	 - SSIS
	 	* Check config mgr

+ If we see "hypervisor" then we are dealing with a VM
	- Is this a storage subsystem?
	- Only one drive?  Or SAN?

+ Is mixed auth enabled?  
	Login > New Login > Can select (a) Windows auth, (b) SQL Server auth

+ Are there any firewall port exceptions?

+ What is the
	- Memory
		Ex. 2.3 GB
		* This can be checked in the task Mgr
	- CPU
		Ex. 2 processors (virtual cores) = 2 * cores
		* This can be checked in the task mgr
	- Free storage
		> Ex. 200 GB free in E:\ drive
	- Also, check the System window (ctrl panel)

+ Document all findings in the One Note document
	O - stands for good
	X - stands for bad

+ SSMS > properties > memory 
	- See how many GB of cache SQL can eat
		* Can SQL cache its DB?
		Ex. 
			> OS needs 1-2 GB
			> MI will also take up RAM (~2 GB)
			> SQL DB = 5.5 GB

+ sqlserverupdates.com
	- This is a good resource 

+ Check SQL Login accounts
	- See config mgr
		* Are these the same users?
	


Source Server:
**************
+ SQL Jobs
	- These need to be moved
	- These are defined in the "msdb" db
	- Logins and permissions are stored in the "master" db
	- Restoring these is a process that is more involved.  As such, it is easier to
		* Script out these jobs
		* Recreate permissions

+ Maintenance plans that use SSIS are not so easy to recreate (vs SQL jobs)

+ How is MI connecting to SSMS?
	- Windows auth?
	- run "sp_who2"
		* Anything < 50 is system
		* As for > 50...
		Ex. 
			> NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
			> Why is "usr" given sysadmin privileges?

+ Services.cmd encapsulates services.msc?

+ Note that "usr" login = "mwuser" user in ssms
	- Hence we must
		GRANT EXEC ON $SP TO MWUSER -- "ON $SP" is optional


--------------

+ Check the Server Properties
	- Memory
		* Min
		* Max
	- Security
		- Login auditing
		- Mixed auth?
	- DB settings
		- Compress backup checked?
	- Advanced settings

+ Security > Logins
	- Note down and insure they exist in the new server

+ Check the SQL Services Account









------------

3rd party, windows, task-scheduler

	jobs apart from SQL
	we can only move jobs that are native to SQL server (that we can script out)
		jobs running under the SQL Server Agent

are they planning to decommission the old server?
	we are only responsible in moving MI related DBs

backup exec 
	a backup job that creates a sql server database




==========================
Old Server
==========================

There is a scripts that gives internal details of the system
	Not easy to see in grid mode, so send it to text.  Then copy over into Notepad++
	Query completed with errors because it's an older version of SQL
	Look at server configuration
		max server memory (MB) - with defaults, we can bring a server under under memory pressure to a halt
			should be 80-85% of max memory of the machine
			select @@version
				Look in msdn for recommendations
				glenn berry sql server			
			Properties > Memory
				OR View Faces > Server Configuration > MaxServerMemory
			minimum 1024 (1 GB)
		Don't worry about processor affinity
	xp_cmdshell (?)
		Allows SQL Service cmd_shell access (DOS commands)
			Used to execute http downloader (calling application via cmd line and capture output)
		View Faces > Server Configuration > XPCmdShellEnabled
			Turn on
	cost threshold for parallelism (different from Max Degree of Paralellism!)
		5 -> 20
		It takes more effort to parallelize nowadays
			Not the best idea
	Bring to the customer's attention that there are other databases (which we don't touch)
		Look at medical DB
			MDL & LDF sizes
	Examine user logins	
		administrator	These are local
		arussell		These are local.  Find out what this is all about.
		sa 				These are local
		SWHA\Medinfo.	Make sure that these come over 
		SWHA\nevis		Make sure that these come over
		usr				Make sure that these come over

		Create a script to export these accounts
			Scripts will also export the password (encrypted) and SID
				SID is important.  It must match.
			Create an sp in the master database
				export_sql_users, which encrypts user PWs and contains -- run in master database
					sp_help_revlogin
						copy scripts and delete what we don't need
			When running scripts, we may need to temporarily create a database
		Make sure usr account is not in sysadmin role
	Examine permissions for each database
	Security > Credentials
		Portal credentials
			select * from sysmail_log (use msdb database)

See OneNote document
	Create step-by-step document
		Each customer is a little bit different

Check if the client has SSAS
	Try logging into SSAS using machine name
		select @@servername, copy results, then
	Can also check from Config Mgr
	This will tell us if they are using the dashboard OLAP

SQL Server 2000 will require to doing an intermediate upgrade (cannot jump directly to 2016)


Summary:
Configured Max Memory from default to 6400 MB. 80% of Max
Enabled xp_cmdshell
Installed sp_help_revlogin to master database.
Run sp_help_revlogin to generate list of users to export to new server with password (encrypted)
Created a blank database labeled medical (necessary to import user account with default database setting).
Imported user account "USR" from production server to new server.
Removed blank database labeled medical.

===================================
Conference Call
===================================

Patient Portal is using notification services
	2014 Google disabled account

Database is only 4GB
	Backups are not taking place
		This means the log file will continue to grow
			Manual backups have been done
		Maintenance plan does not exist?
	Put in a maintenance plan and migrate it
		Email me path where you would like backups to go
	Only "medical" db needs to be migrated (not CMS)

Users
	aRussell - web designer
		tied to the cms database
		forgo this account

When would you like to do the actual migration?
	Do not migrate MI and DB on the same day!
		Do application migration after the DB migration
			Right before app migration, the production data will be put on read-only mode and be transferred over again.

Clarify ports and IP addresses
	Will it remain the same?

Clarify that there are no interfaces
	Less work is terms of reconfiguring IPs

Server name?  If same, then there will be no configuration changes.

Once we get a copy of that share, we will restore the new database

==============================
Setting up Maintenance Plans
==============================

They have not have a successful backup.
	Let's backup the database using SQL.

DBCC LOGINFO('medical')
	Status of 2 means it's in use
	There are entries with status 0, which means it has grown	
	Medical.ldf (log file) contains 747 VLF files.	Too many.  Can lead to fragmented log file, which can slow performance.

Kimberly Tripp and Paul Randall (oversee SQL project at Microsoft)
	Too many or too few log files
		Set it to 1GB and it creates 8 VLFs and let it grow at 1GB a piece
			Set the log file so it doesn't grow (especially at percentages, as it will grow exponentially)

Tasks > Backup 
	Destination: Disk
	The Agent doesn't have access to the shared drive
	Cannot access the config mgr
	Send email
		Is the SQL Server Engine service running under a network account or local system account?  I can access Z: via our medinfo account just fine; however, SQL Server cannot see the folder I created for the backups.  Can you adjust your policy to permit the SQL Server service account access to the folders on Z:?
		The service account for SQL Server Agent will need to be granted access privileges, since the backup jobs will run under the context of the sql server agent.
	Backup name
		medical_full_201701311034.bak
		System denied, access denied
	SQL Server Agent is the one backing it up.  It will need access.


=========================================
Exact Migration Steps
=========================================

Z:\Database Backups

Jason sent a link 
	\\swha-srv\zbackups\medical
		These are where backups have been going

1. At 1pm Central, we will place "medical" in "read-only" mode
	Properties > Options
		Color will become grey
2. Take a backup copy 
	Script action to a query window
		medical_backup_20171300000.bak
		medical_backup_20171301_migration.bak
	It is easier to kick off the backup manually, instead of using a job
3. cmd > echo %computername%
		on the new server
	Run > $computerName\e%
		Navigates to the E:\ drive
			Create folder "Migration_Database"
				Copy bak file into this new directory
5. Drop "bogus" database in new server
	When dropping, be sure to "close existing connections"
6.  Restore new database
		Make sure that checkboxes are not checked
		Query into the new database (select top 10 * from clmaster)
7. dbcc checkdb('medical') WITH NO_INFOMSGS,ALL_ERRORMSGS
	This should come back very clean
	While this is running, the database is still usable
	Log: "Run Successfully -- No issues"
		select * from sys.dm_exec_requests
		This will allow us to see where "dcbb checkdb" is
8. Set database from "read-only" to "read-write"		
9. select * from clparms as [a] where 1=1 and a.code='erx' and a.skey='up'
		This will show where ALPHA1 & 3 points to
			If they point to old server, the download will fail.  This must be updated to point to the new directory
10. exec util_newcrop_import @checkSyslog = 0, @debug = 1
	Needs to be after the 20th day of the month, so nothing will be downloaded
		exec util_newcrop_import @filename="NCTSV-201701.EXE', @checkSyslog = 0, @debug = 1  --using last month's file
			If files are downloaded, then erx downloads are working
11. Set old database to offline
	Tasks > Take offline
12. Update Medinformatix Application (MSETUP) database setting to point server to new server.  Connections verified.
13. Check if there are any "sql orphaned users" (report)
14. Restart MI Services to make sure that the database is pointed to the new one
		exec sp_who

!! Prepping all the jobs is the key to a successful migration
!! Be sure to keep a log of all the steps and what time they were executed!!

+ In general, it is bad practice to put backup files (.bak & .trn) in the same drive as the data & log files (.MFD & .LDF)
+ SSIS Proxy?
+ SQL Jobs must be scripted out and re-run on the new server

# COMPREHENSIVE EYE

John Reinhold [10:53 AM]
i asked him about that and he seemed set on having a single partition since it's a vm and they'll be taking bare metal backups of the host and vm...still, i think it's good to suggest this too.  the site is really small so looking at the current sql server ram/cpu's should give you some idea. he didn't say if they had a certain number of core licenses or not, just "i'll do whatever you guys say"
